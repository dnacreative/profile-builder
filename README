Installation Profile Builder for Drupal

This is a simple system for building installation profiles for Drupal 7. The
idea behind the system is that you create a unique installation profile for
each project, but that profile is based on a common foundation. The 
template profile should be maintained and refined over time, so new projects
benefit from the improvements.

The base.* files are an example profile.  The build-profile.sh script is used
to generate the installation profile.
