Installation Profile Builder for Drupal

This is a simple system for building installation profiles for Drupal 7. The
idea behind the system is that you create a unique installation profile for
each project, but that profile is based on a common foundation. The 
template profile should be maintained and refined over time, so new projects
benefit from the improvements.

The base.* files are an example profile.  The build-profile.sh script is used
to generate the installation profile.

You should try to keep your installation profiles pretty lightweight and handle
most of your configuration in features. Configuration changes that don't fit
in a module or a feature can be included in the installation profile.
